He now primarily uses mixed media for all of his paintings with mediums such as acrylic/Latex, oil paint, ink, watercolor and aerosol spray paint. Many pieces of his work are inspired by nature, color, patterns, lettering, landscapes plus much more. His day to day work focuses on thought provoking concepts and original imagery that is timeless and speaks to all walks of life.

I have a strong desire to assist people to experience life more fully. Through realism, careful attention to detail, rich colors and unusual points of view, my art can prompt a viewer to marvel at existence, to be more keenly aware of their surroundings and be more intrigued with their environment and their life."

During this time, he also cultivated his artistic skills and launched his creative business. Joe began his career showcasing art at First Fridays in downtown Phoenix and has since grown into a full-time artist whose work has taken him to Oregon, Nevada, and Alaska. His portfolio includes large-scale murals—some spanning over 100 feet—as well as smaller, highly detailed canvas pieces. His clients include national brands such as Chick-fil-A, Sam's Club/Walmart, Lectric E-Bikes, and Cheba Hut, as well as local businesses and private residences. Proficient in multiple mediums, Joe primarily works with Latex and Acrylic brush paint as well as spray paint and airbrush, and he tailors his approach to suit the environment and surface. When he's not creating his own personal art pieces or working on his craft, he listens closely to clients' visions, offering artistic guidance to enhance the final result of his clients' projects. His focus is always on exceeding expectations—a goal supported by repeat clients and glowing reviews. Over the past six years, Joe has built a reputation for bringing vibrant, meaningful art to a wide range of spaces, combining technical precision with bold creativity in every piece he creates."

During this time, he also cultivated his artistic skills and launched his creative business. Joe began his career showcasing art at First Fridays in downtown Phoenix and has since grown into a full-time artist whose work has taken him to Oregon, Nevada, and Alaska. His portfolio includes large-scale murals—some spanning over 100 feet—as well as smaller, highly detailed canvas pieces. His clients include national brands such as Chick-fil-A, Sam's Club/Walmart, Lectric E-Bikes, and Cheba Hut, as well as local businesses and private residences. Proficient in multiple mediums, Joe primarily works with Latex and Acrylic brush paint as well as spray paint and airbrush, and he tailors his approach to suit the environment and surface. When he's not creating his own personal art pieces or working on his craft, he listens closely to clients' visions, offering artistic guidance to enhance the final result of his clients' projects. His focus is always on exceeding expectations—a goal supported by repeat clients and glowing reviews. Over the past six years, Joe has built a reputation for bringing vibrant, meaningful art to a wide range of spaces, combining technical precision with bold creativity in every piece he creates."
